# IBI-SEG-HCV-model

This repo provides the code which supports the analysis undertaken by the Statistics Expert Group for the Infected Blood Inquiry in 2022. The full report can be seen here: https://www.infectedbloodinquiry.org.uk/sites/default/files/documents/Expert%20Report%20to%20the%20Infected%20Blood%20Inquiry%20-%20Statistics.pdf. 
In particular, this repo recreates the analysis in the preprint: ADD LINK. This focuses on the statistical model used to estimate the number of individuals who were infected with, and who subsequently died from, hepatitis C virus (HCV) from contaminated blood transfusions.

This model is structured in terms of 6 tasks. This repo contains all of the code used to produce the results. We are unable to share much of the data that we used as we are not the owners of said data, but we reference everything that is publicly available in the paper.
