# IBI-SEG-HCV-model

This repo provides the code which supports the analysis undertaken by the Statistics Expert Group for the Infected Blood Inquiry in 2022. The full report can be seen here: https://www.infectedbloodinquiry.org.uk/sites/default/files/documents/Expert%20Report%20to%20the%20Infected%20Blood%20Inquiry%20-%20Statistics.pdf. 
In particular, this repo recreates the analysis in the preprint: ADD LINK. This focuses on the statistical model used to estimate the number of individuals who were infected with, and who subsequently died from, hepatitis C virus (HCV) from contaminated blood transfusions.

This model is structured in terms of 6 tasks. This repo contains all of the code used to produce the results, and wherever possible we also share the accompanying data.
